# OpenCV Colour Detection and Tracking

This project utilises computer vision techniques to detect and track colours in real-time using OpenCV in Python.

## Features

- **Colour Detection:** The application detects predefined colours in the webcam feed and highlights them.
- **Colour Tracking:** Users can adjust the HSV sliders to fine-tune the colour range to be detected and tracked.
- **Simple Interface:** The user interface provides an intuitive way to adjust HSV values and visualise the masked result.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/colour-detection.git
   ```
2. Run the application
     ```bash
     python app.py

## Usage
1. Run the desired script (app.py for colour detection or color_finder.py for adjusting HSV values).
2. Use the HSV trackbars to adjust the colour range to be detected or tracked.
3. View the webcam feed and observe the masked result highlighting the detected colours.

## File Structure
- `app.py` - Script for detecting and tracking predefined colours in real-time.
- `color_finder.py` - Script for adjusting HSV values to fine-tune the colour detection range.

## Dependencies
